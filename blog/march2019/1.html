			This show is a mix of quantum leap and sliders and the truman show mixed with fringe/twilight zone.</p>
<p>The whole thing is a never ending story just like I rant about. The first dimension is in a book. The second one is in a tv show, and that third was in probably a Virtual Reality video game... :)</p>
<p>I have talked about this type of Nth wall break before</p>

<h2>This is literally a Digital Never Ending Story example.</h2>
<p>They did it! They are using the example I laid out. This show is a mix of quantum leap and sliders and the truman show mixed with fringe/twilight zone.</p>
<p>The whole thing is a never ending story just like I rant about. The first dimension is in a book. The second one is in a tv show, and that third was in probably a Virtual Reality video game... :)</p>
<p>I have talked about this type of Nth wall break before</p>
<p>and I have also talked about the synchronized duality reality they showed at the season finale!   I have more to say on this than what I said in this video, but it's a good place to start for you.</p>
<p>fyi, they are in an echo, OA backwards is AO, alpha omega...</p>

<p>The OA is Sophia from the gnostic legends. She and her angel army are being trained to be fearless angels or to face their own devils and accept them.... or she may become the devil. not sure :)   Hap will likely turn good, and yes I know I was calling him Hal. Cause I relate him to Hal in 2001 Space Odyssey. He's just a pawn being used by the game like an AI....</p>
<p>OK, so now that I know what they are doing.... You get it right? This show is literally doing the never ending story thing.... where a book is talking about another story that is telling yet another tale that is about another book that is being written as we speak...</p>
<p>first story is a story in a book. They goto book world. and book world ends up being a tv show being filmed on a set.... TV set world likely ends up being a virtual reality, in a video game.... And I am just taking a wild guess here, but the original life before the bus accident was probably a poem or a bed time story or daydream...or some other such equivalent. but if I am right, one of the stories wraps around and is telling the original story.<br />
I am blown away by this show simply because it is literally half of everything I am ranting about all the time. All be it, maybe I am projecting some of my own into what they are showing, but I don't think so.....<br />
The idea behind this show has always been my worst fear. That something like this happened to me. lol I won't rant on it. But I have been pretty sure I'm not in my original reality for decades now...and While I think this show is only showing us half truths about things they are still showing us some pretty insane truth... i dunno.</p>
<p>Another thing to point out, one of the episode was called Syzygy</p>

<p>Break it apart to sy-zygy and pronounce it wrong.</p>
<p>On urban dictionary a sy is A Pimp ass mother fucker who owns bitches in different area codes.</p>
<p>Zygy is ziggy.  now combine the Two and think about Al and Ziggy as a duality pair in Quantum leap :) LOL<br />
It's a shoutout... but from what level and where hahaha<br /><br />

syz·y·gy<br />
/ˈsizijē/Submit<br />
nounASTRONOMY<br />
a conjunction or opposition, especially of the moon with the sun.<br />
&quot;the planets were aligned in syzygy&quot;<br />
a pair of connected or corresponding things.</p>
<p>And in the show the term is being used to describe a group of people following each other through the multiverse like a constellation of stars following each other through the night sky!</p>
<p>You guys probably aren't seeing this the way I am... I wish you could... I tried though. ;)</p>

					<h2>I always thought it was complicated. It's just a poem!</h2>
The poem that mentions a book whose story is in a movie that is played in a video game that is actually the world you exist in that has a synchronized virtual reality where your AI creations dream about a self aware computer writing the poem...
