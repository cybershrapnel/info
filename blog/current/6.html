<p>So, I try not to rack my brain considering the &quot;Upworld&quot; aspect of there possibly being a base reality above our reality. I typically focus my efforts towards drilling down and instantiating new layers of sub dimensions as it just seems more productive than what Geohotz is talking about with &quot;getting out&quot;. Getting out  just seems anti productive to me to think about. Drilling down is where the fun is! But I get it now, he's just a hopeless romantic... :D</p>
<p>Let me explain what I mean. I have been thinking about the topic of &quot;Upworld&quot; pretty much non stop for the past two days now as I really have shelved the idea of Uplanders and Upworld as it really is too meta for most people...</p>
<p>But....... Then I realized something!!!!! Something AWESOME!!!!! :D</p>

<h2>What did Billy Joel know???</h2>
<p>hmmmm... :O</p>
<p>He even mentions that she is looking for a &quot;Downtown Man&quot;!!!<br />
Say it in your head the &quot;right&quot; way...</p>
<h2>&quot;Down&quot; - Town - Man</h2>
<p>as in the man from the downtown. the downworld.</p>

Her simulated NPC husband from the simulation was her &quot;Downtown Man&quot;</p>
<h2>WTF?!?</h2>
<p>Shit just get hella meta!</p>
<hr />
<p>If you are confused right now it's totally OK!<br />
Take a deep breath (or 3) and go back and watch the video in the link below of Geohotz at SXSW explaining Upworld to the public and then my followup video regarding his video.<br />
Warning! You will need about 90 minutes and some simulated snacks! :D</p>
