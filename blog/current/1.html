<p>Pre-register for a free AI safety cert!</p>

<p>All certs will be created in the IPFS cloud and the hash address of the cert will be stored in the NanoCheeZe block chain as an ascii text block transaction which will be loadable in app or via api on the block explorer website to view certifications listing.</p>
<p>Upload any relevant files you  want included in your IPFS cert. This is extremely preliminary and things will likely change a bit before I actually start embedding information into the block chain. No data is being uploaded yet. This is a pre-registration.</p>
<p>You can also let the future know if you want to opt out of either simulations :D<br />
ancestor or future resurrection...</p>

<p>A lot of people literally ask me how you could possibly opt-out of something like that. Well this is how. You sign up for a certification that is permanently stored on record in the block chain where the future will actually be able to check and see that you opted out. I myself, opt out of the ancestor simulation, but I'm cool with the future simulation as long as I have control of my data... Which is why we need a MEQUAVIS!</p>
<p>And my reasoning there is that future simulated/resurrected me could un-opt-out of the ancestor simulation once the technology was perfected and assuming I had control of my data as mentioned above :) but that's a slippery slope if simulated me could undo my opt-out choice if it wasn't really me. lol</p>
<p>We can of course include special instructions along with your opt-out request too of course...<br />
There is a file upload option to include additional content for your IPFS entry. There will likely be rules on what can be included here. unsure though... Haven't thought that far ahead lol</p>
