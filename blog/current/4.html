<p>I was just contemplating that if my and yours and everyone elses life is just part of some crazy simulation reality TV show from Upworld. Do you think people tune in on Fridy nights or whatever and see us watching &quot;our&quot; TV shows in the background of their TV shows and wonder &quot;huh, I wonder if that shows any good&quot; and then would they have access to directly watch our TV, remind you, they can probably watch our show from any angle, with any lighting, with whatever plot following whoever they want. so watching our boring TV would be like watching TV with handcuffs on.... Have you ever thought about this?? It's reversing the mirror of what The Never Ending Story Showed us. In that story they showed us going down, creating a dream world that finds out or knows there is an Upworld that created them and their world... This would look up the schism of the fractal and wondering if they can or would watch our boring TV shows would be the question. Or maybe they wouldn't be so boring to them if they had access. Or maybe they wouldn't have access to them period. Or maybe our TV shows wouldn't even be real in that sense and they are just a hallucination we all see and think we are watching but for the Upworlds watching Earth TV they just see cheesey cartoon graphics on our TV screens in the background and it would be like brainwashing from the movie They Live that makes us think we are being entertained and watching something.... Or we are watching something but the simulation system for the show would replace what they see in Upworld with what I just said. So we watch our shows but they would see a censored version of it that isn't interesting so that they don't get curious about watching our TV shows. Maybe to remove the possibility of developing empathy for a simulated subuniverse's civilization :D What do you think?? I could go on. but let's stop here before I lose everyone....</p>
<p>OH, one last thought, Our TV could be their TV and Hollywood could just be a big scam and deception they pull. and the movies they produce are just downloaded straight from Upworld that gives us access to their library of movies periodically, but that would mean all the characters here are clones or copies or caricatures of the real people in Upworld... so.... and they would have to make those people actors in Hollywood as some subsystem protocol... :) haha</p>
<p>A guy at one of the auto parts stores I service the other day told me he thinks he's just an extra in said reality show and his part was already over and his part was just some guy that came in to buy an air freshener from him and it's done... Asked him if it smelled good and he got to say, yah, that's a good one... the rest of his life is just going through the motions he said... It was all preparation for that one moment on Upworld camera... I laughed pretty hard... I gotta stop melting people's brains... :D
